### Requirements (place an `x` in each of the `[ ]`)**
* [ ] I realize finplot is not a web lib. (Hint: it's native!)
* [ ] I've read the [snippets](https://github.com/highfestiva/finplot/wiki/Snippets) and not found what I'm looking for.
* [ ] I've searched for any related issues and avoided creating a duplicate issue.
* [ ] I've updated finplot (`pip install -U finplot`).
* [ ] I've supplied the required data to run my code below.
